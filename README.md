Irritability is a core symptom and diagnostic criterion for various psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents, including disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and dysthymia. Investigating how specific parenting ideologies and behaviors influence irritability may provide insights into the impact of a child's family environment on the development and maintenance of child irritability, which may inform targeted interventions to support healthy child development.

Using three-wave longitudinal data from the Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS), the current study examines concurrent and longitudinal associations between child irritability, parenting behaviors and parenting stress across different race and ethnicity groups. Novel cross-sectional and temporal network analysis methods (Epskamp, 2020) were employed to understand the complex interrelations between child irritability and parenting behaviors/stress, within and between different cultural contexts.

Overall, the results demonstrate that parenting behaviors and stress were associated with child irritability within and over time across different racial/ethnic groups. Importantly, this study showed bidirectional effects between parenting behaviors/stress and child irritability across ages 3, 5, and 9. Results also indicated both similarities and differences in the temporal associations between race/ethnicity groups. That is, physical assault and non-violent discipline predicted future child irritability consistently across race/ethnicity groups. However, child irritability predicted increases in parental neglect in White but not Black participants. Parenting stress was bidirectionally associated with child irritability in Black participants only. 

Future work is needed to elucidate factors relevant to each race/ethnic group and culture that contribute to these similarities and differences. By investigating how parenting behaviors are associated with child irritability and how these associations vary by culture, our results may inform tailored, culturally-sensitive interventions to support families in promoting positive child outcomes and well-being across diverse cultural backgrounds.
